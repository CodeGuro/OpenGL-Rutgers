controls:

Use the left mouse button to select one of the three (and/or/not) gates
use the the middle mouse button (scroll bar button) to connect the output terminals to input terminals between gates
use the right mouse button to select the wire color, wire type, or to quit the program

Using the Program:
	Gate Selection:
		Select one of the three logical gates on the top-left corner of the window.
		Once selected, click anywhere else in the program, below the selection list, to place a copy of that gate
		Select on a different gate to change selections
		The gate defaults to "logical or"
	Wire Selection:
		Right click and use the submenu "Wires" to select the appropriate wire
		Once selected, select a color for the wire
		If selecting an "XYX" or "YXY" connection, the fraction buffer clears and you must put in a fraction in decimal form (example: 0.233) in the program (not the terminal!) and then press "enter" or "return"
		The color defaults to red.
		The connection type defaults to "XY"
	Wire Connection:
		Use the middle mouse button to first select the output terminal then the input terminal to connect the gates		
	Terminal:
		The terminal will output selections, gates, and wire connections, as well as the fraction number, if selecting an XYX or YXY type wire
Closing the Program:
	To close the program, simply right-click and press 'Exit'. Alternatively, you can press 'q' to quit or press the 'Esc' button


Compiling:

The bulk of my program is located at "./opengl/opengl/src/main.cpp"
This project is best compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or higher.
Double click the 'opengl.sln' if on a microsoft platform to compile/run the project.
If compiling on a *NIX derivative, make sure to set two global preprocessor directives
( GLEW_STATIC and FREEGLUT_STATIC ) to enable static compilation the project.
If you don't want to use glew/freeglut, remove the #includes at 'main.cpp' and replace it with
the appropriate header files. Glew is an extention library I needed, and freeglut is backwards
compatible with the deprecated original glut library. Provided also in "./Release" 
are the binary files necessary to run the program on a windows platform.
If for some reason, it fails to compile, you can run it with that.


Licence:

The licence I included is an MIT licence.
Basically, I'm enabling you to do whatever you want with my source code
with no strings attached. It also serves as a disclaimer that there is
no warranty (I doubt you need it anyway, it's a small assignment).
