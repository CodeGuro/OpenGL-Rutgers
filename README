controls:
use the x,y,z keys to go in the direction of the axis
in upper case, the direction is positive in the respective axis
in lower case, the direction is negative in the respective axis
the direction faced will always be toward (0,0,0) by default
use the left click button random trajectories or a birds eye view
also a custom trajectory can be set by specifying the position, look-at location, and go-to directions
specify them in x y z format, with no spaces or parenthesis (i.e. <4.2, 10.5, 3.4> would be 4.2 10.5 3.4
to stay stationary and look in a different direction, let the position and go-to position be the same coordinates
the look-at direction vector may not be parallel to the up vector (i.e. you may not be standing in <0,0,10> and looking at <0,10,10>
but the look-at direction vector may be -nearly- parallel with the up vector (i.e. standing in <0,0,10> and looking at <0,10,9.9999>

Terminal:
Closing the Program:
	To close the program, simply right-click and press 'Exit'. Alternatively, you can press 'q' to quit or press the 'Esc' button


Compiling:

The bulk of my program is located at "./opengl/opengl/src/main.cpp"
This project is best compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 or higher.
Double click the 'opengl.sln' if on a microsoft platform to compile/run the project.
If compiling on a *NIX derivative, make sure to set two global preprocessor directives
( GLEW_STATIC and FREEGLUT_STATIC ) to enable static compilation the project.
If you don't want to use glew/freeglut, remove the #includes at 'main.cpp' and replace it with
the appropriate header files. Glew is an extention library I needed, and freeglut is backwards
compatible with the deprecated original glut library. Provided also in "./Release" 
are the binary files necessary to run the program on a windows platform.
If for some reason, it fails to compile, you can run it with that.


Licence:

The licence I included is an MIT licence.
Basically, I'm enabling you to do whatever you want with my source code
with no strings attached. It also serves as a disclaimer that there is
no warranty (I doubt you need it anyway, it's a small assignment).
